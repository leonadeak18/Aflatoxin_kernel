About this data:

Spectral measurements were acquired using an UV-Visible-NIR spectrometer (2DCCD-512x64, Control Development, Inc., South Bend, IN), UV-Visible-NIR light source (Ocean Optics, Inc., Dunedin, FL), and a light-emitting diode fiber optic probe (Ocean Optics, Inc., Dunedin, FL). The light source produced wavelengths of light every 0.5 nm from 304-1,085 nm (n = 1,563 wavelengths), which were emitted through the end of the fiber optic probe. The end of the probe was held against the surface of the embryo side of each kernel and the kernel’s reflectance at each wavelength was detected by the spectrometer. The intensity of light reflected by each sample (percent reflectance relative to a calibration reference) at each of the 1,563 wavelengths is referred to as the kernel’s spectral signature.
